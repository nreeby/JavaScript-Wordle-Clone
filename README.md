# JavaScript-Wordle-Clone
After making a calculator in JavaScript I then tried my hand at making a Wordle clone
This was much more difficult than the calculator I have mad previously. The first main struggle I had was the work flow and where to begin after completeing the html and css.
It was all about breaking it down into small problems to solve 
Things I ave taken away from doing this are that I should use magic numbers as they make my code arder to read, 
before doing anything think through possible roots you can take to cause a solution,
small simple maths can optimise your code
